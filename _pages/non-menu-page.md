    Graphene, a one-atom-thick sheet of carbon atoms, is renowned for its exceptional strength. But its resistance to fracture isn't uniform in all directions. By examining the atomic steps formed on graphite surfaces, we show that graphene  tend to crack more easily along certain orientations. This directional dependence, known as anisotropic fracture, is crucial for the functioning of graphene-based devices and relevant to a unique toughening mechanism in 2D materials.

    Graphene, a one-atom-thick sheet of carbon atoms, is renowned for its exceptional strength. But its resistance to fracture isn't uniform in all directions. By examining the atomic steps formed on graphite surfaces, we show that cracks in graphene tend to propagate more easily along certain orientations. This directional dependence, known as anisotropic fracture, is crucial for the functioning of graphene-based devices and relevant to a unique toughening mechanism in 2D materials.
