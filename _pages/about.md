<p style="margin-top: 1.2em; margin-bottom: 0.2em; font-size: 1em;" markdown="1">
I am a <span style="color: #910f0f"><strong>postdoctoral researcher</strong></span> in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics at the <span style="color: #3b65a3"><strong>University of Pennsylvania</strong></span>. I received my PhD and BS degrees in Mechanics from <span style="color: #3b65a3"><strong>Tsinghua University</strong></span>.

My research explores how materials slide, deform, and fail at solidâ€“solid interfaces, especially at <span style="color: #910f0f">micro- and nanoscale</span>. I study fundamental processes governing <span style="color: #910f0f">friction</span>, <span style="color: #910f0f">fracture</span>, and <span style="color: #910f0f">stress-driven chemical reactions</span>, which lead to striking behaviors like near-frictionless sliding and exceptional properties of atomically-thin 2D materials. These insights support advances in micro/nanodevices, high-performance coatings and interfaces, flexible electronics, and sustainable manufacturing through mechanochemistry.

I take a <span style="color: #910f0f">multidisciplinary approach</span> combining mechanics with materials science, physics, and chemistry. I work extensively with <span style="color: #910f0f">atomic force microscopy (AFM)</span> for nanoscale tribological and mechanical studies, and build custom experimental setups when needed. I also use diverse characterization tools (SEM/TEM, EDS, XPS, EBSD, etc.) and microfabrication techniques. These experimental efforts are complemented by simple theoretical models with clear physics intuition whenever possible.
